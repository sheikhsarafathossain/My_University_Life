Implement java code for a functional calculator that can solve mathematical expressions. i.e., 2*6+8-10/3=?

Consider the validity of an expression. i.e., something divided by zero is not valid. 1++2=?, 1/+6=?, 6+6-=?; these are invalid

You may use existing expression solving algorithm/solution to solve the result

Implement feature to keep last 20 expressions in storage (use shared preferences)

Any copy-paste will be given straight zero. There will be no consideration. However, there will be partial marks whatever you do by your own.
